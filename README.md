Guide to working w/ Jim Daniel at $COMPANY


The leadership philosphy I follow is servant leadership. I love to discuss why I believe in this model, feel free to bring it up in our 1:1s. 

I believe in building durable teams that can function independent of any particular leader. I love a high bus factor! No silos!

My favorite word in the English language is decoupling. It's an incredibly powerful concept that allows us to accelerate work by making decisions independently. This is how we deliver against large, ambiguous projects.


Im not an extrovert but I play one on TV. By that I mean I can be an extrovert in the office but I need to recharge in my off time. Don't expect too much communication from me during off hours. If we are communicating during off hours, I apologize in advance if I'm not at my best.

I believe that vacations are part of your negotiated compensation and you should take them. You wouldn't give up your paycheck or RSUs - don't give up your vacation days either - you lose what you don't take.

### Communication Tenets
If I need you urgently, I will page you directly. For all other comms from me, reply during your work hours. Just because I chat or email you in the off hours/on your day off doesn't mean I need an immediate reply - it means I had something to communicate to you and I don't want to forget about it.


### Estimating Software Projects
Owning a software service (distributed or not) comes with an overhead that I refer to as the 'service ownership tax'. This is a a broad label, meant to encompass many things:

- 24/7 oncall
- host patching
- SDK/client updates
- emergency fixes

Essentially, service ownership tax refers to all work required to operate a service that is not feature-related. It's non-negotiable and you *must* plan for it.
